				<h2 class="title">Introduction</h2>
				<ul>
					<li>Passkeys have been around since personal phones existed.</li>
					<li>A tap sequence used as a passkey offers infinite unique combinations</li>
					<li> Our results show that it is possible to authenticate using a unique tap sequence, and convenient enough to be used every day to unlock a personal device.</li>
				</ul>
				<h2 class="title">Problem</h2>
				<ul>
					<li>Current devices have only a four-digit passkey which isn't very secure.</li>
					<li>A tap sequence is a much more complex passkey.</li>
					<li>Every tap sequence can be unique for each user, unlike a traditional four-digit passkey.</li>
					<li>Tap sequence is practically impossible to brute force because their are infinite possibilities.</li>
				</ul>
				<h2 class="title">Background</h2>
				<ul>
					<li>TapSongs [2] first introduced the idea of a tap sequence being used for authentication in 2009.</li>
					<li>A tap sequence is a set of timestamps recorded by an application.</li>
					<li>Minimum requirements for tap authentication include the relative timestamps of the up/down presses [1].</li>
					<li>The sequence can be made more complex by adding coordinates, pressure or area.</li>
					<li>To compare the tap sequence vectors the Hamming distance can be used.</li>
					<li>Hamming distances measures the minimum number of substations required to change one vector to another [3].</li>
					<li>We used a variation of the Euclidean distance which is the sum of squares of data sets for each vector.</li>
					<li>Our algorithm also took into account standard deviation which allows for margin of error when entering a passkey.</li>
					<li>Based on a calculated dissimilarity score, we can decide whether the correct sequence was entered.</li>
				</ul>
				<h2 class="title">Approach</h2>
				<ul>
					<li>The first prototype on an Android device was implemented.</li>
					<li>The application let us test the capability of mobile devices and their ability to run the algorithm quickly.</li>
					<li>This prototype allowed us to verify the practicality and usability of this approach of authentication.</li>
					<li>Since only two tap sequences need to be compared (key and attempt), this is a very fast feedback loop.</li>
					<li>The approach is unique because every single passkey is distinct due to micro variations.</li>
				</ul>
				<h2 class="title">Results</h2>
				<ul>
					<li>Tap sequences are extremely hard to replicate.</li>
					<li>Can be made easier by only comparing intervals of presses.</li>
					<li>This was demoed by the web application (this).</li>
					<li>This allows us to match the sequences reliably while keeping a reasonable acceptance rate.</li>
					<li>The algorithm returns a dissimilarity score which indicates how close the master and trial sequences are.</li>
					<li>It was found that more complex patterns were more secure while still being relatively easy for the user to replicate.</li>
					<li>The next step was to start recording statistics to better improve acceptance rate by tweaking the algorithm or the acceptance score.</li>
					<li>After many tweaks, a tap sequence proves to be a reliable way of verification for the average user.</li>
